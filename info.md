# openHASP Custom Component

This custom component simplifies synchronization of objects on one or more openHASP(https://www.openhasp.com/) plates with Home Assistant entities. An openHASP plate is basically a small touchscreen device which you can mount on the wall in place of a switch, and you can design your custom user interface for it using json. You can build your own hardware but you can also buy them ready-made.

You can map any service supported by any entity in Home Assistant to any object event in openHASP, moreover, you can set any property of any object in openHASP to any value from Home Assistant. This powerful concept gives you full freedom to create a completely customized, hardware-based control user interface for your home automation.
